# Google Wallet Card Creator
The "Photo" option of Google Wallet is very easy to add a card to your wallet,
but sometimes you have a card without barcode that you do want to keep in the wallet app.

This website allows you to easily add a barcode to your card image so you can import it and keep it with the rest of your cards.

## Features
- Select card image
- Add a barcode based on text input
- Drag the barcode to a desired spot on your card image
- Resize the barcode so it fits anywhere on your card image
